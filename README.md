How do we find ord(a) = r? The strategy is to calculation the function FN(x) for many values of x in parallel
and to use Fourier techniques to detect the period in the sequence of function values. In the next subsection
we show Shorâ€™s quantum algorithm does this efficiently using the quantum fourier transform.
